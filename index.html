                    <h3>Hades</h3>
                    <p>In the Lore Olympus webtoon, Hades, the God of the underworld, takes center stage. Often depicted
                        as a handsome blue man in a business suit, Hades runs the Underworld Corporation, serves as the
                        older brother of Zeus and Poseidon, and plays a role in the Six Traitor Dynasty. His character
                        takes on the burden of leadership and pursuing personal interests.</p>

                    <h3>Persephone</h3>
                    <p>Persephone, the goddess of spring, is the story’s heroine alongside the underworld. Initially
                        portrayed as an innocent and naive young woman, her character develops dramatically as she faces
                        more challenges.
                        Persephone is depicted with pink skin and a generous heart, a stark contrast to the harsh
                        reality of Olympus. Her journey included discovering her strength, and she dealt with the trauma
                        of being raped by Apollo, as well as her strong feelings about the underworld.

                    <h3>Zeus</h3>
                    <p>Zeus, the king of the gods, is depicted as a yellow-skinned man with long, straight hair. Known
                        for his promiscuity and egotism, Zeus’ actions often brought chaos to Olympus. A member of the
                        Six Realms of Lies, he has intimate relationships with many characters, including his brothers
                        Hades and Poseidon, and many lovers. His character provides a lens through which to examine
                        issues of power and corruption.</p>

                    <h3>Poseidon</h3>
                    <p>Poseidon, the God of the sea, is Zeus’s brother from the underworld. He is usually characterized
                        by a carefree and quick temperament, portrayed with green skin and long, wavy hair. Despite
                        being slightly less witted, Poseidon is very loyal to his family. His relationship with his wife
                        Amphitrite and their polygamous arrangement add an intriguing dynamic to his character.

                        of Persephone’s best friends and knows the depression she is enduring. Eros is supportive and
                        loving, often helping to nurture other romantic relationships as he deals with his challenges,
                        including his relationship with Psyche.
